# Contributing to Visual Data Structure App

We are thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the Visual Data Structure App! This document provides guidelines for contributions and aims to make the process as easy and transparent as possible.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the application:

1. Check the [issues](https://github.com/daniel-souza/Visual-Data-Structure/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue.
2. If the bug hasnâ€™t been reported, [open a new issue](https://github.com/daniel-souza/Visual-Data-Structure/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

For any suggestions for enhancements:

1. Open a new issue and clearly describe the enhancement, including rationale for the change and how it would be beneficial.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/daniel-souza/Visual-Data-Structure/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Getting started

For detailed information on setting up your environment and the development workflow, see [README.md](https://github.com/daniel-souza/Visual-Data-Structure/blob/master/README.md).

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Questions?

Feel free to contact the project maintainers if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
